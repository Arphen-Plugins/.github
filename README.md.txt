# Arphen-Plugins

A team of two university students maintains this project, which aims to make cheap and configurable projects available to everyone. Additionally, we believe in **freemium** (where every plugin is free, and only paid if you need support or cannot compile the project yourself).
Also, please note that only one of us is a developer, so if you have problems, **please be patient**.

## Version Support
The plugins we offer are based on the last version of **paperspigot**. You don't need to make a bad review if you aren't using paperspigot or have any errors, **we will try our best to help you migrate**.

## Donations
You can make donations directly to our **[Paypal](https://paypal.me/diogommsousa)**
